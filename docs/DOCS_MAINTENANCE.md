# Documentation Maintenance

## Update Cadence
- Update docs at each sprint and release.
- Minimum set to update: DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md, DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md, FEATURES_STATUS.md, CHANGES.md.

## Workflow
- Propose changes via PR with clear summary; link tasks and issues.
- Required updates on code change: at least one of DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md, DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md, GAP_ASSESSMENT.md, or relevant module plans.
- Acceptance criteria and validation steps must be recorded.

## Verification
- CI checks for broken links and required document changes per release.
- Manual review ensures goals and statuses are consistent.
