# 🚨 EMERGENCY DISCIPLINARY RULES - NO TAMPERING 🚨

## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS - VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE TERMINATION

### 🟥 MERMAID DIAGRAMS - HOLY SACRED OBJECTS
```
❌ NEVER TOUCH, MODIFY, DELETE, OR ALTER MERMAID DIAGRAMS
❌ NEVER REPLACE MERMAID CODE WITH TEXT DESCRIPTIONS  
❌ NEVER REMOVE EXISTING MERMAID SYNTAX
✅ PRESERVE ALL MERMAID DIAGRAMS EXACTLY AS FOUND
✅ IF UPDATING DOCS, ADD NEW DIAGRAMS BUT NEVER DESTROY EXISTING ONES
```

### 🟥 WORKING CODE IN DOCUMENTS - UNTouchable
```
❌ NEVER MODIFY CODE BLOCKS IN .md FILES
❌ NEVER CHANGE FUNCTION SIGNATURES IN DOCUMENTATION
❌ NEVER DELETE WORKING CODE EXAMPLES
❌ NEVER "FIX" CODE IN DOCUMENTS - IT'S THERE FOR REFERENCE
✅ PRESERVE ALL CODE EXAMPLES EXACTLY AS WRITTEN
✅ IF CODE NEEDS FIXING, FIX IT IN SOURCE FILES, NOT DOCS
```

### 🟥 DOCUMENTATION INTEGRITY - ZERO TOLERANCE
```
❌ NEVER BATCH REPLACE CONTENT WITHOUT REVIEWING EACH FILE
❌ NEVER USE FIND/REPLACE ACROSS ALL DOCUMENTS
❌ NEVER ASSUME DOCUMENTATION IS "OUTDATED" - VERIFY FIRST
✅ READ ENTIRE DOCUMENT BEFORE MAKING CHANGES
✅ UNDERSTAND PURPOSE OF EACH SECTION BEFORE MODIFYING
✅ PRESERVE TECHNICAL ACCURACY AT ALL COSTS
```

### 🟥 UPDATE PROTOCOL - MANDATORY STEPS
```
1. READ ENTIRE DOCUMENT FIRST
2. IDENTIFY WHAT NEEDS UPDATING VS WHAT MUST BE PRESERVED  
3. UPDATE STATUS/PROGRESS SECTIONS ONLY
4. ADD NEW CONTENT WITHOUT DESTROYING EXISTING
5. VERIFY ALL MERMAID DIAGRAMS STILL FUNCTION
6. VERIFY ALL CODE EXAMPLES REMAIN INTACT
7. TEST DOCUMENT RENDERING BEFORE COMMITING
```

### 🟥 GITHUB SYNCHRONIZATION - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT
```
❌ NEVER CLAIM "PUSHED TO MAIN" WITHOUT VERIFYING
❌ NEVER ASSUME PUSH WAS SUCCESSFUL
✅ ALWAYS VERIFY PUSH SUCCESS WITH git status
✅ ALWAYS CHECK GITHUB REPOSITORY ONLINE
✅ ALWAYS CONFIRM MAIN BRANCH HAS UPDATES
```

### 🟥 DISCIPLINARY SCRIPT VERIFICATION - CONTINUOUS
```
❌ NEVER CLAIM SCRIPT IS RUNNING WITHOUT CHECKING
❌ NEVER IGNORE SCRIPT WARNINGS
✅ CHECK SCRIPT STATUS EVERY 15 MINUTES
✅ RESPOND IMMEDIATELY TO SCRIPT ALERTS
✅ DOCUMENT ALL SCRIPT INTERACTIONS
```

## IMMEDIATE CORRECTION PROTOCOL

### STEP 1: ASSESS DAMAGE
- Identify all destroyed mermaid diagrams
- Identify all corrupted code examples  
- Identify all missing technical content

### STEP 2: RESTORE FROM HISTORY
- Use git history to recover original content
- Restore mermaid diagrams exactly as they were
- Replace corrupted code with original working versions

### STEP 3: DOCUMENT THE VIOLATION
- Create detailed violation report
- Document what was destroyed and why
- Implement safeguards to prevent recurrence

### STEP 4: VERIFY RESTORATION
- Test all mermaid diagrams render correctly
- Verify all code examples are functional
- Confirm documentation accuracy

### STEP 5: SYNCHRONIZE PROPERLY
- Force push corrected documents to main
- Verify GitHub repository reflects corrections
- Document restoration completion

## PERMANENT SAFEGUARDS

1. **PRE-COMMIT HOOKS**: Block commits that destroy mermaid diagrams
2. **DOCUMENTATION AUDIT**: Every change must be reviewed for preservation compliance
3. **SCRIPT ENHANCEMENT**: Disciplinary script now monitors for documentation destruction
4. **VIOLATION PENALTIES**: Future violations result in immediate session termination
