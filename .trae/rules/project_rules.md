# Project Rules - WGSL Shader Studio

## Critical Development Rules

### 1. File Management
- **NEVER create duplicate files** - Always update existing files instead
- **No multiple versions** of the same file (e.g., visual_node_editor.rs, visual_node_editor_new.rs, etc.)
- Check for existing files before creating new ones
- Use existing files as templates for modifications

### 2. Feature Implementation Assessment
- Provide honest assessment of what's actually implemented vs claimed
- Document actual functionality, not planned features
- Test compilation before claiming features work
- Reference repository code must be properly integrated,
